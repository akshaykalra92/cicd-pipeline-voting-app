# CICD Pipeline for voting Application

## Overview

This repository contains the CI/CD pipeline configuration for the Voting Application. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a seamless and consistent workflow.

## Features

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated testing and validation on every code push.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automated deployment to staging and production environments.
- **Containerization:** Uses Docker for packaging the application and its dependencies.
- **Orchestration:** Leverages Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized applications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following tools are installed and configured:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- CI/CD Tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

Deploy to Production
Deploy the application to the production environment after successful testing in the staging environment.

Configure CI/CD Tool:

Set up your CI/CD tool to trigger the pipeline on code changes. Refer to the documentation of your chosen CI/CD tool for specific instructions.

Configure Pipeline:

Update the pipeline configuration file (e.g., .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile) based on your environment and requirements.

Environment Variables:

Define the necessary environment variables in your CI/CD tool for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials). Do not store sensitive information directly in the code.

Run the Pipeline:

Trigger the pipeline manually or push a code change to initiate the automated process.

**Pipeline Steps**

**Build**

Build the Docker image for the Voting Application.

**Test**

Run automated tests to ensure the application behaves as expected.

**Deploy to Staging**

Deploy the application to the staging environment for further testing.

**Deploy to Production**

Deploy the application to the production environment after successful testing in the staging environment.
